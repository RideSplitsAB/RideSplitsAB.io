            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND RIDE SPLITS TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR JURY TRIAL.</strong></p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Ride Splits Platform</h2>
          <p>The Platform functions as a technology-based marketplace that connects individuals seeking transportation services ("Riders") with independent third-party individuals offering transportation ("Drivers") who are traveling in a similar direction. Ride Splits solely facilitates these connections through its digital application and is not itself a transportation carrier, common carrier, or provider of ride services.</p>
          
          <p>Drivers who utilize the Platform do so as independent contractors or third-party providers and are not employees, agents, or representatives of Ride Splits. Ride Splits does not control or direct the manner in which Drivers operate their vehicles or provide transportation services. Each Driver is solely responsible for determining whether, when, where, and under what terms to offer rides. Ride Splits makes no guarantees regarding the availability, quality, safety, or legality of rides arranged through the Platform.</p>

          <h2>1. Contractual Relationship</h2>
                      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and Ride Splits Inc. ("Ride Splits," "we," or "our"). By accessing or using the Ride Splits platform (the "Platform") through our mobile application or website, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Platform.</p>

          <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
                      <p>Ride Splits provides a digital platform that enables riders and drivers to connect for the purpose of arranging carpool transportation. Ride Splits does not own vehicles or employ drivers. All transportation services are provided by independent third-party drivers ("Drivers").</p>

            <li>Allow the app to display estimates of money saved (riders) or earned (drivers) based on your usage.</li>
          </ul>
                      <p>All payments are final unless otherwise determined by Ride Splits. Tips are voluntary.</p>

          <h2>5. Arbitration Agreement and Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you waive your right to a jury trial and agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual arbitration, not in court. This includes all claims related to your use of the Platform, subject to the following exceptions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Claims eligible for small claims court.</li>
            <li>Claims related to sexual assault or harassment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Safety and Ratings</h2>
                      <p>Ride Splits may collect ratings from riders and drivers. Repeated low ratings may lead to account suspension. Riders and drivers are responsible for:</p>

            <li>Using appropriate child restraint systems.</li>
