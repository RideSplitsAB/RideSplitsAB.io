RideSplits - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
What should I do if no rides are currently available for my route?
If no rides are available, you can check RideSplits communities related to your organization, school, or
workplace. Many commuters in those groups regularly post rides, so it’s a good place to find options
that match your route.
Who can become a RideSplits driver and what are the requirements?
Anyone 18+ with a valid driver’s license, insurance, and a safe vehicle can become a driver. Drivers
must also pass a background check. RideSplits is designed primarily for commuters sharing their usual
routes, but people offering gig rides are also welcome — under their own flag.
How much does RideSplits charge in service fees?
Drivers keep 70% of what they charge. Riders pay an additional 10% service fee at checkout. This
applies to both one-time rides and recurring rides.
What payment methods are accepted?
RideSplits accepts credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay through Stripe. Drivers must
set up their Stripe account before offering rides.
When do drivers receive payout after completing a ride?
Driver earnings accumulate throughout the week. Balances are paid out every Friday, covering rides
completed during the past week and weekend.
What is a RideSplits 'usual ride' subscription?
Drivers can set up their usual commute (e.g., daily drive to work/school) and arrange weekly or monthly
payments with recurring riders. This gives riders better pricing and guarantees their spot, while drivers
still earn the same share (70%) and riders still pay the 10% fee if they’re on the free plan.
How does RideSplits handle disputes or complaints?
Disputes are handled through RideSplits’ customer service hotline and email. Our support team will
review the situation and provide assistance.
I’m having trouble signing in — what should I do?

Try resetting your password first. If the issue continues, please contact customer service by hotline or
email for help.
Can I book a driver with a luxury car?
Yes, if a driver offering rides happens to have a luxury car. However, RideSplits does not offer specific
'luxury categories.'
Can I charge more if I drive a V8?
Yes. Drivers set their own prices, so if you believe your vehicle justifies higher fares, you’re free to set
them accordingly.
Can I book a drive to Japan?
We’d love to say yes, but no — RideSplits can’t do that… yet. RideSplits planes soon enough? Just
kidding (or maybe not ■). For now, we only operate on the ground.
What about coupons or incentives?
Yes, but they are seasonal and depend on when you signed up. Keep an eye out for promotions
available during your period of membership.
Can you handle multiple stops? I want to get coffee before going
home.
Yes, multi-stop rides are supported! Just make sure to talk with your driver beforehand so everyone is
on the same page.
Do you have wheelchair-accessible vehicles?
Not yet. This is an amazing idea, and RideSplits is working on implementing this feature in the future.
Can you pick me up in 5 minutes on the moon?
Hmmmm… interesting concept. If you know how to make that happen, please work for us and teach us!
For now, we’re not able to provide rides to the moon.
Cancel my ride — oh wait, actually reschedule it.
You can cancel rides directly in the app. If you want to reschedule, we recommend messaging your ride
buddy first, since they may not be available at a different time. If not, you can always look for more rides
in the app.

How do I change my profile picture or personal information?
Go to Profile → Settings → Edit Profile. Update your information, then press Save.
Where can I view past and upcoming rides?
Tap Start Ride, then drag the slider screen upward. You’ll see both completed and upcoming rides
there.
Can I pay with PayPal/Apple Pay/credit card?
PayPal is not supported (yet). Apple Pay, Google Pay, debit, and credit cards are all accepted through
Stripe.
Change my preferred pickup address.
Go to Profile → Usual Commute → Change My Usual Commute and update your address there.
