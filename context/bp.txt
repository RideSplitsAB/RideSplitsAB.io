The ProductRide Splits is an app that connects people of similar origins and destinations
so they can carpool together. Unlike traditional ride-sharing services, Ride
Splits allows everyday commuters to offer rides along their usual routes,
picking up other people in exchange for money.
The LeadershipAhmed Burgos is an American who grew up in Colombia. His goal is to
reimagine the way business is done in the world, where goodness and value
is prioritized over profits, but not at the cost of one self. He strongly believes
that “Sustainability is a competitive advantage”, that’s why he’s building a
brand that yells the idea of sustainable committing. 
The Overall
IndustryIn the United States, nearly 70% of people drive alone to work, less than 5%
carpool, and a low 3.1% take public transportation. Ride Splits  aims to make
carpooling one of the most relevant commuting methods in the country, and
with this bring benefits that no other app has been able to achieve. “We are
not competing with a company, we are competing against the industry rule”.
The CompetitorsApps attempting similar models like PopaRide, or BlaBlaCar have been
successful in areas similar to the United States. None of them have reached
the amount of connectivity nor the aspire to connect regular commuters,
Ride Splits focuses on sharing rides for the long terms with new concepts like
RideBuddies, Communities, or Event-Based Carpool.
The Financial
StatusRide Splits aims to raise initial funding of $50,000 that will cover the main
expenses for the market introduction, maintenance, updates of the app, and
marketing. We currently have risen $5,000 from family, peers, and
competitions won. We hope to rise the rest from grants, partnerships, and
collaborations with other organizations, and our local peers.
Future PlansBy 2026, once our concept is proven, we are looking to expand into
more universities, schools, and workplaces of the region, and work
our way around to proudly become the main connector for
commuters for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Connections Made Easy
Ride Splits is a com m unity-based carpooling platform
that connects people who are already headed in the
sam e direction. The way it works is sim ple: drivers
post their usual routes—like going from  hom e to
school or work—along with the tim es they travel and
how m uch they charge. Riders search for a m atch,
book a seat, and pay directly through the app. Drivers
get a little extra m oney to help with gas and
m aintenance, and riders save on transportation costs
without needing to own a car or rely on expensive
rideshare apps. Everything is handled in-app,
including paym ents, ride details, and built-in safety
features like em ergency contacts and ride tracking.
It’s designed for routine, repeat trips—perfect for
students and workers with set schedules.
W hat sets Ride Splits apart is its focus on real,
everyday users—not gig drivers or tourists. W e’re
starting with students at CSUSB, but the platform  is
flexible enough to serve com m uters, event-goers, and
even local organizations over tim e. W e plan to offer
features like weekly ride subscriptions, wom en-only
rides, and eventually partnerships with em ployers and
public agencies. Our approach is different because it
focuses on long-term  com m uting needs, not short-
term  rides. By helping people share their daily trips,
we’re reducing costs, cutting em issions, and creating
a m odel that can grow from  one cam pus to an entire
region—without losing its com m unity-driven feel.Ride Splits
“Carpool to reduce emissions, split costs, and meet new friends”
3As we grow, our focus will stay on affordability and accessibility. M any people in regions like
the Inland Em pire are stuck paying high transportation costs because public transit isn’t
reliable and car ownership will becom e out of reach. Ride Splits gives them  a real option
that’s faster, m ore affordable, and better for the environm ent. 

Free Tier
Riders and drivers will start off with the free tier
of Ride Splits. This version charges platform
fees of 10% for every ride to riders, and takes
20% of the drivers’ proposed ride fee. For
drivers this free trial only lasts up to three
m onths, riders can choose if they would like to
switch to a paid plan at any tim e.
Rider Subscription
Riders can switch up to a paid subscription at
any tim e, this will rem ove any platform  fee
while m aking available other features like rides
on dem and, or insurances on bought rides that
were cancelled last m inute. 
Driver Subscription
After a 3 m onth free trial period, or before.
Drivers will switch up to a paid plan which will
allow them  to offer rides for events,
com m unities, and at no platform  fee. W ith the
subscription drivers are expected to m ake
m ore from  Ride Splits while keeping a steady
source of incom e for the com pany.Free

Additionally, in the future we will m ake partnerships
with governm ental organizations, private

The History
The transportation industry has seen rapid evolution over the past two decades, shaped by
rising urban populations, climate concerns, and advances in technology. Traditional services like
public buses and trains have been joined by ride-hailing apps (like Uber and Lyft), micro-mobility
(e-scooters, bike shares), and carpooling platforms. Globally, the shared mobility market is
projected to surpass $400 billion by 2030, with peer-to-peer carpooling gaining renewed
interest due to growing environmental awareness and the rising cost of vehicle ownership.
Historically, carpooling was informal—based on personal networks or bulletin boards—but new
platforms like Ride Splits are formalizing and modernizing the practice using mobile technology.
Today’s trend is clear: people, especially younger generations and those in underserved regions
like California’s Inland Empire, are seeking affordable, community-driven alternatives to owning a
car. As cities struggle with congestion, emissions, and infrastructure strain, solutions that reduce
solo driving and empower local commuters—like Ride Splits—are well-positioned to lead the next
wave of sustainable transportation.
U.S Commuting
patterns
What’s striking in today’s commuting landscape isn’t
just that most Americans still drive alone—it’s that
even after a global shift toward remote work, the
majority of workers have returned to long, solo
commutes despite higher gas prices, tighter budgets,
and growing concern for the environment. This leaves
a huge population of workers and students stuck
between unreliable transit and the high cost of full-
time vehicle use. Ride Splits enters this space not just
as a rideshare alternative, but as a reimagining of how
commuting should work—anchored in flexibility,
routine, and local connection. By tapping into existing
routes and everyday drivers, Ride Splits doesn’t try to
replace transit or compete with rideshare apps—it fills
the massive space between them with something
built for how people actually live today.

Our solution
International platform s like Poparide and BlaBlaCar have successfully popularized real
carpooling by connecting people traveling between cities. W hile their m odel proves that
peer-to-peer ride sharing works, especially across regions in Europe, India, and Brazil,
Ride Splits takes that concept and shifts the focus. Rather than just coordinating one-
tim e, long-distance trips, Ride Splits is built to help people form  ongoing connections for
regular com m utes—especially within cities and local com m unities. Our approach
em phasizes long-term  affordability, environm ental im pact, and building trust am ong
riders and drivers who share the sam e routine. By adapting a proven concept to m eet the
needs of everyday com m uters in the U.S., we’re offering a fresh solution to a persistent
problem .
W e do recognize that carpooling is not the norm  in the United States, and getting people
fam iliar with this concept is going to be hard. That’s why want to launch a benefits
program  with the support of local governm ents, a driver and a rider’s journey where they
will unlock certain rewards as they carpool m ore often:

Goals Challenges
Secure a job in her field of study.
Graduate on time.
Go to medical school.Some job openings are
inaccessible to reach through
bus from her destination.  
Going to school is either one
hour bus or $20 Uber/Lyft. Some
classes are offered outside of
reachable bus times. 
Her nearest medical school is in
LA, she would have to move or
get a car. 
Goals Challenges
Find a job in her field of study.
Live as stress-free as possible.The Inland Empire as a region
lacks the supply of jobs in her
field, it’s easier to find one in LA.
Rising gas prices and overall
maintenance of her old car that
she HAD to buy 2 years ago is
taking ⅓ of her total income!!
College students from commuter schools
Car dependency is not an issue that is limited for a specific sector of people. However,
commuter schools throughout the United States usually are low to mid level income
student serving institutions with very specific and fixed routes of commuting. Ride Splits’
target audience is the average commuter that is struggling with daily car expenses and
upcoming generations that don’t want to buy just any car for their subsistence. You can
find this population specially present at community colleges, local universities, and
sometimes but not as present in regional job commuting nodes like warehouses in the
Inland Empire.

The #1 reason why carpooling apps have failed
before is...
Once they get on the app, save their commuting information, and they find none in their
area, “Nobody is trying to carpool, why should I?” a student we interviewed said.  That’s
why we will focus on making sure that first connection happen, by adapting our strategy
to small communities that already have commuting nodes in common, like universities.
For the next 6 months our marketing strategy will be 100% focused at CSUSB.
The 4Ps of Marketing
Our strategy will focus heavily on product recognition, social media promotion, physical
reach, and monetary incentives. Small to Big ApproachMarketing Plan
Product 
Ride Splits = Sustainability
Our color set, our logo, styling, even
materials choice for promotionally items.
Everything that we do has to do with
sustainability in some way our another, that
is our standard and the brand that we sell.
Price 
Ride Splits is real ridesharing!
Ride Splits model of real ridesharing means
that people split costs, not charge for a ride.
Prices should be around 2x or 3x more
affordable than other ridesharing platforms.
Additionally, we’ll have an early rewards that
gives gift cards for top riders and drivers.
Place  
Events/ Tabling/ Ambassadors
To build physical presence in campus, we
have created the Ride Splits club which
officially gives us access to school funding,
creation of events, and access for tabling at
different events. We plan on taking
advantage of all of these resources to raise
awareness about Ride Splits. 
Promotion 
Marketing focused on learning
Online we plan on posting educational
materials that are meant to ensure Ride
Splits is used as intended, as potential users
learn about the impact that our vehicles
have on the planet, we raise awareness for
an issue that we are also the perfect solution
for.

Initial investment
Due to the power of AI and the am bition of our team , Ride Splits has able to accom plish
som ething that alm ost no other tech com pany has been able to do. W e have fully
researched and developed Ride Splits 1.0 with only the initial investm ent from  our
founder. The next step is different, heavily concentrated in m arketing, sales, and in
m aking new connections.  Below is the breakdown of costs for the upcom ing sem ester:
Financial Outlook
Thanks to partners that we have m ade along the way, Ride splits doesn’t need to look for
extra investm ents that would go into legal services or tech m anagem ent because these
costs are already covered by our partners, thus our expenses at an initial stage will be
significantly reduced. Below are our projections for the end of 2025 and 2026:

Carpooling would be the #1
commuting method in the
United States2028
Connect commuters all
across the United States. We’ll be the #1 ridesharing
app in the world!
That’s the goal! But where do we start? We start
local, Cal State San Bernardino is the perfect place
to test and refine the idea, it has a vast amount of
people who share similar origins and destinations. 
We will use the money provided to work tirelessly
into penetrating the CSUSB market. The first step
is to publish the app, register as an LLC, buy the
necessary insurances, and establish official
contracts and a an official system. The second step
happens on August 23, where we will host a small
event on campus which will set the official launch
of Ride Splits. This is the start of our journey. 
From September, all the way until the end of the
semester in December the idea is to get feedback
from our early users, make the necessary updates,
and reach our first 1,000 users locally (CSUSB
population is ~18,900 students).
  
As we do that, we will be working on raising the next
amount of funding, making the necessary
connections, and preparing everything so Ride
Splits can start handling background checks, setup
the rewards program, and ensures that its
infrastructure is ready to handle the next step of
the plan, introducing effective carpooling programs
to the low income population of our region, and
partnering up with FIFA to seize the world cup as
the biggest opportunity that Ride Splits has to
scale fast!
