RideSplits – How to Become a Driver
Step 1: Start in the RideSplits App
Open the RideSplits app, go to your Profile, and tap 'Become a Driver'. You will see a checklist of what
you’ll need before you continue.
Step 2: Confirm Your Profile Basics
Make sure your name, email, and phone number are correct. Upload a clear photo of your driver’s
license and enter your vehicle details (make, model, year, color, license plate). Provide proof of
insurance if requested.
Step 3: Background Screening
Consent to the background check. This is required for all drivers to ensure safety. You can continue
using the app while this is processed.
Step 4: Set Up Your Payouts with Stripe
Tap 'Set Up Payouts' in the app. A secure Stripe screen will open. Choose your account type: -
Individual / Sole Proprietor (most drivers): provide your personal information and SSN (last 4 digits). -
Company/LLC (optional): provide your business details. Add your payout method: bank account
(routing + account) or eligible debit card. Submit your information to Stripe.
Step 5: Return to RideSplits
Once Stripe onboarding is complete, you will return to the app and see a status banner: - Ready: You
are approved for payouts. - Pending Review: Stripe is still verifying information. - Action Needed:
Additional information is required.
Step 6: Create Your 'Usual Ride'
Set your typical commute (origin, destination, times, and days). You can make it visible to everyone or
to specific communities like your school or workplace.
Step 7: Set Your Price
Drivers set their own prices. Riders will pay your price plus a 10% RideSplits service fee. You keep
70% of your fare.
Step 8: Post Rides & Coordinate

From your 'Usual Ride', tap 'Post Ride' or accept rider requests. Multi-stop rides are supported—just
communicate with your riders beforehand.
Step 9: Start Driving
Once approved, you are officially a RideSplits driver! Coordinate with riders, complete rides safely, and
track your trips in the app.
