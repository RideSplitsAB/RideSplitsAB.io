RideSplits – How Driver Payment Works
Earnings Breakdown
Drivers keep 70% of the ride fare they set. Riders pay an additional 10% service fee at checkout.
RideSplits takes the remaining portion as a platform fee.
When You Get Paid
Your ride earnings accumulate throughout the week. Payouts are sent every Friday to your linked bank
account or debit card through Stripe. Your first payout may take longer while Stripe verifies your details,
but after that, payouts are regular each Friday.
How Payouts Work
RideSplits uses Stripe to handle payouts securely: - Riders pay through Stripe (via card, Apple Pay, or
Google Pay). - Stripe deposits your share into your Stripe Express account. - Funds are transferred
automatically to your chosen bank account or debit card on Fridays.
Changing Your Payout Method
You can update your bank account or debit card anytime from the RideSplits app under Profile →
Earnings. This will open your Stripe Express dashboard where you can manage payout details.
Refunds and Disputes
If a ride is refunded, RideSplits may adjust your balance. In the event of a dispute, RideSplits and
Stripe review the issue. If a charge is reversed, funds may be deducted from your balance.
